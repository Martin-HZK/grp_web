# [P2023‑16] Online Virtual Dressing Room

## Requirements

This project will require students to have knowledge and skills in web‑based system development
and machine learning methods, including HTML, Python, SQL, classification, face detection, image
processing, etc.

## Background

The traditional shopping experience often involves visiting physical stores and trying on multiple
clothing items to find the right fit and style. However, this process can be time‑consuming, inconve‑
nient, and limited by factors such as store availability and fitting room spaces. The concept of a virtual
dressing room software stems from the desire to provide users with a convenient and immersive way
to try on different outfits without physically wearing them. This technology has gained popularity in
recent years due to advancements in computer vision, augmented reality, and e‑commerce.

## Outline

The objective of this software is to design an online virtual dressing room application that allows users
to try on different outfits virtually. The key requirements for this software are as follows:

- Image Capture: The software should be able to capture user images using the device's camera
or webcam.

-  Intelligent Face Replacement: The captured image should be processed to replace the user's
head with a chosen outfit's image intelligently.

-  Outfit Selection and Styling: The application should provide users with the ability to choose
from a variety of clothing styles and outfits.

-  Quick Outfit Change: Users should be able to easily switch between different outfits with ac‑
ceptable delay.

-  Fast Display of Outfit Images: The software should efficiently display the selected outfit images
on the user's face within the dressing room.

-  Easy Navigation of Outfit Combinations: Users should be able to quickly browse through various
clothing combinations and view outfit images.

-  Clothing Categorization and Recommendations: The application should have a built‑in feature
that categorizes clothing items and provides recommendations based on user preferences.

## Tasks & Deliverables

- **User Interface**: The software will have a user‑friendly interface that allows users to interact with
the virtual dressing room. This includes features such as uploading images, selecting clothing
items.

- **Virtual Clothing Catalogue**: The software will provide a wide range of virtual clothing items for
users to try on. This catalogue may include different types of clothing such as tops, bottoms,
dresses, etc.

-  **Computer Vision Technology**: The software will utilize computer vision algorithms to analyse
user images and detect face measurements accurately. This technology enables the proper fit‑
ting and placement of virtual clothing items on the user's image.

- **Save and Share Functionality**: Users will have the ability to save their favourite outfit combina‑
tions and share them.

- **Clothing Recommendation System**: The software may include a recommendation system that
suggests outfit combinations based on the user's style preferences, previously saved outfits.
This feature enhances the user experience and helps users discover new styles.

## Project Overview

E-commerce has been rising rapidly in popularity. The way we shop has changed. Everyone used to have to go to retail stores in order to shop for things. E-commerce allows shopping with a single push of a button. During its rise, online clothing stores started popping up, initially not being as popular. During the recent pandemic, online clothing stores were the only option. One by one, more and more clothing stores appeared. Small businesses, huge businesses all joined in. In some countries, they end up being the new normal.

Even with this industry rapidly gaining popularity, thereâ€™s still one thing that makes old school shopping better. Trying on clothes. Not being able to try on the clothes is the worst thing about clothes shopping online. Sizing could be off, might not look good on you, and several other reasons. Some of us do not have the time to be able to drive from place to place to find the right shirt, to queue in the monstrous long lines of the dressing room, the money to spend on gas driving back and forth.

Our aim with this project is to allow everyone to be able to try on clothes from wherever they are. Eliminating that feeling of unsureness before spending their savings on clothes they might or might not like. And even when they are not purchasing, just to have fun trying on different outfits.
